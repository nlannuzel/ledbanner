  - 5 female/male jumpwires to link to the RaspberryPI GPIOs
  - A plyer

For the software:
  - Gordon Henderson's WiringPI library which can be obtained from http://wiringpi.com/ or https://github.com/WiringPi/WiringPi
        git clone https://github.com/WiringPi/WiringPi
  - My simple driver for MAX7219 IC: https://github.com/nlannuzel/max7219
        git clone https://github.com/nlannuzel/max7219
  - If you want to open the diagram file, you need Fritzing: http://fritzing.org/home/
